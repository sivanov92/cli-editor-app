Sed is a stream editor. A stream editor is used to perform basic text transformations on an input stream.

Normally sed is invoked like this:

sed SCRIPT INPUTFILE
For example, to replace all occurrences of ‘hello’ to ‘world’ in the file input.txt:

sed 's/hello/world/' input.txt

Here 's' is the comand for substitude, the word after the first '/' is the word that should be substituted and the word after  second '/' is the word with which we will do the substitution.

Sed writes output to standard output. Use -i to edit files in-place instead of printing to standard output.
The following command modifies file.txt and does not produce any output:

sed -i 's/hello/world/' file.txt


Task:

Implement in any language of your choice a Stream Editor like sed. We expect you to implement just the mentioned above featurees - the substitude 's' command and the -i flag for in-place edit. Send us back your solution with written unit tests and READ.me file with instructions how to execute/use your code and the unit tests
